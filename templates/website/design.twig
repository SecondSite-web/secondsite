                <p>Some websites fall into a category that don't suite CMS systems. You website needs could be too advanced
                    in terms of functionality, or just too simple. We build websites from the ground up that are
                    completely custom and specifically built and tailored to your needs.</p>

                <p>Custom builds are the best for static sites that don't change often, like basic informational business sites,
                    or very complex sites that require advanced functionality, like directories or estate agent sites that CMS
                    systems don't provide.
                    So, instead of bending a CMS to your needs, we build a custom website.</p>
